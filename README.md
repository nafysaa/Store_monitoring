1. Error Handling & Logging ---
Error Handling: We are implementing more specific error handling throughout the application. This includes handling invalid CSV formats, missing data, and mismatched time zones.
Logging: A centralized logging system has been added using Python's logging library. Logs are now captured to help diagnose issues in production. For advanced monitoring, we may integrate external logging systems like the ELK stack or Sentry.

2. Data Validation ---
CSV Validation: Data integrity checks are now in place to validate the CSV format before processing. This ensures that required columns exist and are correctly formatted like timestamps, business hours.
Time Zone Validation: We are validating time zone data to ensure it is consistent and providing feedback on necessary corrections.

3. Performance Optimization ---
Batch Processing: For large CSV files, batch processing or parallelism will be used to split the data into smaller chunks, improving the processing speed and reducing memory usage.
Caching: Frequently requested reports will be cached to improve performance, reducing server load and speeding up response times for subsequent requests.

4. Time Zone Handling Enhancements ---
Automatic Time Zone Detection: Time zones can be automatically determined using services like timezonefinder, which maps latitude and longitude data (if available in the CSV) to the correct time zone.
Multiple Time Zones: The service now supports multiple time zones in the CSV and allows users to generate reports based on specific locations or time zones.

5. Scalability ---
Cloud Storage Integration: As the system scales, large CSV files will be stored in cloud-based storage like Google Cloud Storage to ensure smooth handling of larger datasets.
